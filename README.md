# Command-line fluency

This repository contains a small set of tasks designed to quickly assess command line fluency.

The tasks are organized into separate directories and are independent from each other in that
sense. Some refer to this repository itself, so they can affect each other in that sense, still.

## Suggested use

1. Ask the candidate to clone this repository.
2. Have the candidate read this README.
3. Hello, candidate! Please proceed to the README in the directory `task0`.
